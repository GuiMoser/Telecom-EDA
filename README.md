# EDA Telecommunications

This notebook performs an exploratory data analysis on five datasets from the telecommunications company Megaline.

The notebook goes through the entire data cleaning and data enrichment process, merging 5 dataframes into just 1 with aggregated data.

Then creates graphs to analyze user consumption for each plan, to reach the conclusion of which plan generates more revenue.

Finally, perfoms some hypothesis tests to draw conclusions about the plans.
